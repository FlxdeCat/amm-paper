  abstract = {This paper describes a solution technique for Linear Programming problems with multiple objective functions. In this type of problem it is often necessary to replace the concept of ``optimum'' with that of ``best compromise''. In contrast with methods dealing with a priori weighted sums of the objective functions, the method described here involves a sequential exploration of solutions. This exploration is guided to some extent by the decision maker who intervenes by means of defined responses to precise questions posed by the algorithm. Thus, in this man-model symbiosis, phases of computation alternate with phases of decision. The process allows the decision-maker to ``learn'' to recognize good solutions and the relative importance of the objectives. The final decision (best compromise) furnished by the man-model system is obtained after a small number of successive phases.},

  abstract = {`Cold chains' are specialised supply chains that help preserve the quality of temperature-sensitive products, from procurement to fulfilment. They are vital for essential goods, including perishable food and medicine. Due to their refrigeration requirements, cold chains incur higher operational costs, energy consumption, and emissions than traditional supply chains. Additionally, they pose a risk of product decay or wastage. Despite the extensive research on cold chains, there is a need for a comprehensive review of optimisation models to consolidate existing knowledge and identify areas for further investigation. As such, cold chain optimisation models may deliver substantial commercial, environmental and social benefits, warranting a state-of-the-art overview. We employ pertinent keywords to retrieve articles published up to and including 2023 from Scopus, followed by content analysis to select 234 publications from 122 peer-reviewed journals. First, we synthesise optimisation models and solution methods addressing collaboration, strategic network design, storage design, tactical planning and distribution planning. Next, we distil nine components, often unique to cold chains, prevalent in these models. Then, we establish multiple research trends and gaps (related to stakeholders, methodology, technology and novel approaches) in this burgeoning field, which will interest people exploring optimisation opportunities in cold chains. Finally, we point to future research avenues for academics, provide actionable learnings for firms' decision-makers, and outline governmental aspects for policymakers.},
